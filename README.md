# Conventions

This repository will be used to lay down what we believe should be conventions for high quality conferences.
A list of engagements from organizers that should be (more or less depending on the conference's context) followed.
We may not always be the authors of provided documentation, in these specific case you will find the mention @original with the url to the original document.
We are just gathering them all in one place for commodity's sake.
Although these may be used as models, they are mainly thought as a structure for Web-5 Conferences. Hence one should not take for granted everything written here for just any conference :)

In this repository you will find conventions about : <ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/Web-5/RFCs/blob/master/OpenConfExpectations-speakers.md" title="Open COnference Expectations for Speakers">Speakers</a></li>
<li>Attendees</li>
<li>Conferences</li>
<li>Organizers</li>
</ul>
